# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0]
 - Breaking: `release_tweak` is now unavailable if the `release_tweak` feature is not enabled. 
   It used to be available _but_ didn't do anything which was highly misleading.
 - Remove `lazy_static` and `rustc_hash` dependency (updates M.S.R.V. to 1.80). Now dependency-free!

## [1.1.1]
 - Fix `tweak_fn` not compiling if function has doc comments

## [1.1.0]

 - Introduce `derive` feature to allow `#[tweak_fn]` on functions.
 - All calls to tweak are now almost always at most one hashmap lookup.
 - Cache `stat` syscalls.
 - Only read file from disk once per file change instead of per tweak in that file.
 - Add dependency on `rustc-hash` for faster hashing (no need for DOS protection).
 - Support multiline strings in `tweak_fn` proc-macro
 - Support more syntax for integers (e.g `0xFF_FF_u64`) and floats (e.g `1_000.0f64`)

These optimizations heavily reduce the overhead of using tweak!  
This allows the proc-macro adding tweaks to all literals of not being too heavy.
